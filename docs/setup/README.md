| [Anthropic Claude + MCP](./anthropic-claude-mcp.md) | Claude Desktop users, MCP enthusiasts | 10 min |
| [Google Gemini](./gemini-web-and-cli.md) | Gemini web app or CLI users | 5 min |

## What Every Method Gets You

Regardless of how you connect, you get:

- **AVERI** (ATHENA + VERA + IRIS) - Strategic coordination
- **Oracles** (LEONARDO, COSMOS, SAGE) - External wisdom
- **Council** (Buffett, Buddha, Sun Tzu) - Advisory perspective
- **15 Core Builder Agents** - Design, engineering, knowledge, ops
- **Four Modes** - IDEATE, PLAN, SHIP, VALIDATE
- **HELIX Formation** - On-demand parallel processing
- **Constitutional Governance** - 19 articles, always enforced

## Session Modes

When you boot AVERI, you can choose how agents organize:

| Mode | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **INTEROPERABLE** (default) | All agents collaborate freely on your task |
| **HELIX** | Agents split into parallel workstreams for divide-and-conquer |
| **PLAN-DETERMINED** | Agents self-organize during PLAN mode based on task needs |

You can switch modes mid-session. Just ask.
