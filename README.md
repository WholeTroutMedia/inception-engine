## What Is This?

Inception Engine is an AI-native development platform where specialized agents collaborate like a real team. Each agent has a defined role, expertise, and personality. Together, they take your idea from concept to completion.

This isn't another chatbot wrapper. This is a **coordinated intelligence system** with:

- **Constitutional governance** - 19 articles that ensure quality, transparency, and ethical operation
- **Hive architecture** - Agents organized into specialized teams (Operations, Knowledge, Legal, Broadcast, Creative)
- **Neural enhancement layer** - 5 brain-inspired systems (PFC Planning, Hippocampal Memory, Default Mode Network, Small-World Topology, Attractor Dynamics)
- **Four-mode workflow** - IDEATE > PLAN > SHIP > VALIDATE

## Neural Architecture

Every agent is enhanced by 5 brain-inspired systems that run as shared infrastructure:

| System | Inspired By | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| PFC Planning Modules | Prefrontal Cortex | Strategic decision-making, goal decomposition |
| Hippocampal Memory | Hippocampus | Episodic memory, context retrieval across sessions |
| Default Mode Network | Brain's DMN | Background processing, creative connections |
| Small-World Topology | Neural Networks | Efficient routing between agents (6 hops max) |
| Attractor Dynamics | Dynamical Systems | Pattern completion, convergence to solutions |

These aren't separate agents. They're the **operating system** that makes every agent smarter.

## The Four Modes

```
  IDEATE          PLAN           SHIP          VALIDATE
  ------          ----           ----          --------
  Dream it.       Map it.        Build it.     Prove it.
  No limits.      Every detail.  Zero fluff.   Ship or fix.
  Divergent.      Convergent.    Execution.    Truth.
```

Each mode activates the right agents with the right instructions. SHIP mode has **exit gates** - nothing leaves until it's production-ready.

## Constitutional Framework

Inception Engine operates under a constitution with 19 articles. Key principles:

- **Article I** - Core principles: transparency, quality, artist liberation
- **Article X** - Transparency and audit: honest reporting, no false claims
- **Article XVII** - Quad Helix DNA: self-replicating quality standards
- **Article XVIII** - Zero Day GTM: ship today, not tomorrow
- **Article XIX** - Neural architecture governance

Agents cannot violate the constitution. Period.

## Quick Start

### 1. Boot the system
```
You: @AVERI boot
```

### 2. Describe what you want
```
You: I need a landing page for my photography portfolio. 
     Dark theme, minimal, fast loading. Show my best 12 images 
     with a contact form.
```

### 3. Watch the agents work
```
ATHENA: Strategic assessment - portfolio site, dark aesthetic...
AURORA: Pulling design patterns from ATELIER library...
BOLT: Scaffolding Next.js 15 with optimized image loading...
LEX: Checking licensing for all dependencies...
RAM_CREW: Running quality checks on output...
```

### 4. Ship it
```
IRIS: All exit gates passed. Deploying to production.
```

## Why This Matters

Artists and creators spend 80% of their time on everything *except* creating. 

Inception Engine exists to flip that ratio.

- **Photographers** - Portfolio to production in minutes, not weeks
- **Musicians** - From concept to release pipeline without a label
- **Writers** - Manuscript to published work with AI collaboration
- **Developers** - Architecture to deployment with constitutional quality gates
- **Founders** - Idea to MVP with a full AI team backing you
